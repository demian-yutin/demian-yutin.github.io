# Lab Objective

The purpose of this lab was to set up the Artemis board and Arduino IDE which we
will be using for the rest of the semester, and to learn how to use the on-board
LED, the serial message channel, and various on-board sensors.

# Part 1: Arduino Intallation

I was able to install the Arduino IDE and connect it to the Artemis Nano without
any issues, except that the [setup instructions][setup_instr] linked in the 
assignment were slightly outdated, so the example programs I needed were named
differently in my IDE.

# Part 2: Blink

I uploaded the Blink example (Examples > 01.Basics > Blink) to the board. The 
on-board blue LED labeled "19" began blinking on and off every 1 second.
